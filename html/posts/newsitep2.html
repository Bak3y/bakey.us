        Long, long overdue post going over my Ansible config for my DO server that's running this website/blog/thing.  Does it count as a blog if you're writing raw HTML yourself?
        At any rate, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible" target="_blank">Ansible</a> to configure my DigitalOcean droplet after Terraform built it for me.  Why?
        Mostly due to comfort. I taught myself Ansible out of necessity in a previous role where I was able to automate quite a bit with it. It's just what I'm comfortable with. I'm sure the same sorts
        of things could be done with Chef, Puppet, Saltstack, a shell script, python, and so on.

        Ansible essentially connects to a system via SSH and converts the playbooks and roles in <a href="https://github.com/Bak3y/ansible-do" target="_blank">my repo</a> 
        to python scripts to configure <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">docker</a> (which runs the <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container" target="_blank">container</a> for this site), 
        a <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner" target="_blank">GitHub Actions Runner</a> (which provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" target="_blank">ci/cd</a> tooling connectivity to GitHub), 
        and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank">certbot</a>, which gives me free SSL certs via LetsEncrypt and keeps things auto-renewed.
